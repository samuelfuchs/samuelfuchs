#### About me

I started my professional life as a newspaper delivery boy in my teens, I've worked in several areas throughout my life.

I gained vast experience from having lived in Germany and London, during this period I took the opportunity to learn French and with fluency in German and English I was able to improve myself as a Programmer.

Spending hours assembling the puzzle of algorithms in order to deliver a personalized and excellent product to the customer is my greatest commitment.

In the midst of constant studies, I am competent to carry out your order with a wealth of details that will differentiate your business from all others in the market.

#### Hobbies:

- Reading 📚
- Working out 🏋️‍♂️
- Eating 🍖

#### Programming books I like:

- Becomming a better programmer - Pete Goodliffe
- Clean Code - Robert Cecil Martin
- Don't make me think - Steve Krug
- Evil by Design - Chris Nodder
- The Pragmatic Programmer - David Thomas & Andrew Hunt
